# Subscription costs

The Unsub dashboard requires a subscription.

Although our code is [open source](https://github.com/ourresearch/get-unsub), it costs money for us to maintain and operate the service; the subscription fee offsets that cost, keeping [our nonprofit](https://ourresearch.org/) sustainable.

Our support model is based on the size of your library's current annual budget for materials (print and electronic serials, books, and so forth).

Here are the pricing tiers:



| **Library materials budget** (USD) | **Cost** (USD) |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| $0 - 500,000                       | $500           |
| $500,000 - 1,000,000               | $1,000         |
| $1,000,000 - 1,500,000             | $1,500         |
| $1,500,000 - 2,000,000             | $2,000         |
| $2,000,000 - 2,500,000             | $2,500         |
| $2,500,000 and above               | $3,000         |



If you're not able to determine your library materials budget, use your best estimate. If you're on the border between two tiers, feel free to pick the lower one.

If your budget isn't in US Dollars, convert it from your local currency into USD and then use the chart above as usual. Some folks like to use the average exchange rate over the last year, while others prefer to use today's rate; either is fine by us.

If you're looking to get a quote for a consortium, rather than a single institution, see the [Consortium Dashboard](consortium-dashboard.md) page.
