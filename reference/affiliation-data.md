# Affiliation data

Affiliations are a concept that links authors to works. An author declares an institution in their work, and then that information can often be retrieved and then authors can be linked to works through their institutions.&#x20;

The two most obvious ways you'll see use of affiliation data in Unsub are:

* Weighted overall uses used in our Cost Per Use (CPU) calculation for each title
* The APC tab, which is not part of our forecast, uses affiliation data to estimate APC spend for your institution

There are other ways we use affiliation data:

*
* asdf

Affiliation data comes from [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/).&#x20;

We'll have more details here soon regarding update frequency.
