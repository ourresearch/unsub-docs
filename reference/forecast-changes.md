# Forecast changes

### Why does the forecast data change?

Regular data updates are a normal part of the system -- we are constantly improving both the source data and the math that goes into the model.

We don't expect data changes to be large, and in fact we work to make sure they aren't -- we favor frequent small updates over a few big ones. This helps make sure the model is as accurate as possible at any given time, while avoiding big jarring shifts in the model outputs.

If you'd like to be updated of large changes, you can sign up for our very low traffic Updates Announcement list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/unsub-announce); all changes are also recorded [here](https://github.com/ourresearch/jump-api/blob/master/RELEASE\_NOTES.md).
