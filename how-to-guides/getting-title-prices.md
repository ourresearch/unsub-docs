# Getting Title Prices

[A title price is required for a journal to appear in your Unsub dashboard](../troubleshooting/why-dont-i-see-a-certain-title-in-my-dashboard.md).&#x20;

We used to provide publicly available title prices when we supported the big five publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer Nature, SAGE, and Taylor & Francis). This eased the setup process for Unsub because we already had some title prices. However, collecting title prices for **ALL** publishers is not feasible.&#x20;

As before we still recommend that you get in touch with your publisher contact and ask for a pricelist for the ISSNs in your dashboard. We have not heard of Unsub users having problems getting title prices from their publisher contacts.

As an alternative - or in addition - to contacting your publisher, you can use public title prices. These may or my not be different from the specific price the publisher charges you.

The following is non-comprehensive list of places to find public title prices:
