# Tips

### Searching for documentation <a href="#h_f666720dfd" id="h_f666720dfd"></a>

You can full-text search the Unsub documentation - just click Search in the upper right of this page and type out a query.

### Unsub Mailing Lists <a href="#h_e291af921c" id="h_e291af921c"></a>

When your Unsub account is setup, the email address associated with the account does not automatically receive any emails with Unsub announcements.

We strongly recommend you sign up for these two google groups:

* [Unsub Announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/unsub-announce) for important data and user interface updates
* [Unsub Discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/unsub-discuss) for user discussion

### Feedback <a href="#h_8caedea2e7" id="h_8caedea2e7"></a>

Don't hesitate to reach out to us ([support@unsub.org](mailto:support@unsub.org)) with questions or thoughts on Unsub itself, or any aspect of Unsub that could be better documented. We'd love your feedback!
