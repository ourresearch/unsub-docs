# Why don't I see a certain title in my dashboard?

So, you’ve uploaded your COUNTER file(s), and there’s a particular journal you have in mind and you’re not seeing it.

Since Unsub includes all relevant titles in your Unsub dashboard why would a title not be included?

There's a number of reasons a title you expect to see in your Unsub dashboard may be missing. These are those reasons:

* The journal has changed to a new publisher different from the publisher you're modeling. For example, you’re modeling Wiley and the journal is now with Springer.
* The journal has changed to completely open access; in which case, including it in title by title modeling no longer makes sense since you can not subscribe to it.
* The journal has stopped publishing articles.
* Your Unsub package is missing a title price (a-la-carte price) for the journal.[ See here to correct this](../how-to-guides/upload-title-prices.md).
