# Does this work for consortia?

Yes! We have a number of consortia that use Unsub, including JISC ([Joint Information Systems Committee](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/)) and CRKN ([Canadian Research Knowledge Network](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/)). We also have groups of institutions that use Unsub that are are not official consortia, but are, for example, most of the universities in a small country.

There are a few different Unsub set up scenarios to fit different use cases involving groups of institutions:&#x20;

* Central consortium dashboard, with individual institutional dashboards for each consortium member
* No central consortium dashboard - only individual institutional dashboards for each consortium member

A few notes about consortia:

* The consortium is usually the purchasing agent
* Each subscribing institution that is part of the consortium needs to have their own dashboard
* For a consortial dashboard, not all members of a consortium have to subscribe to Unsub. For example, if a library consortium has 20 members, even if only half of them (10) subscribe to Unsub, that is no problem at all
