# What’s the right amount of titles to subscribe to?

There is no right answer!&#x20;

What Unsub helps you do is get the information you need to make a decision for yourself. Here are a few ways to think about this:

If your library is flush with cash, then you can make access more convenient for your users via subscriptions.&#x20;

If your library has a constrained budget, then a great approach is to think about what's the best cost per use. We don’t have to tell you that collections development is about tradeoffs: as you start getting to larger values of Cost Per Use, you get worse value; if you stick to relatively low&#x20;
